# doc2pdf
Compiles Word Documents and PDF files into one big PDF file.

## About
I created doc2pdf so that I could quickly and easily create "Assessment Packages". These "Assessment Packages" are typically made up of a number of documents, so having them all together in one PDF is a lot more convient than having them in multimple seperate files, all in different formats.

With doc2pdf, it is possible to merge any combination of .doc, .docx, and .pdf files together to create one PDF file. You also have the option to add a Cover Page to the merged document, and save your settings to recall and edit later.

## Usage
TODO

## Installing
doc2pdf compiles into one little EXE file.

As long as you've got the .NET Framework and Microsoft Office installed, it should run.

## Built With
* [PDFSharp](http://www.pdfsharp.net/) - Open Source .NET library that easily creates and processes PDFs
* [Microsoft Word](https://www.office.com/) - doc2pdf uses "Microsoft Word 2016" to convert Word Documents to PDF.

## History
This program is based on a little PowerShell script I wrote to do the same thing.
